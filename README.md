# [OUTDATED] Adobe Auto-renew Python Script

Very simple script to renew the trial serial number of an Adobe product.

NOTE: Do backup target application.xml file in case something breaks.

Tested and used only on InDesign 2021, but it's very likely other Adobe products in similar years have the same license expiry check method.

To allow the script to write the changes to the file, enable modify permissions on application.xml file.
To make the script run automatically, use Task Scheduler or add the script to the startup folder.
